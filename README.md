Hello there,
TODO

1. Step 1 - Initial check
	In this step, you need to check if the TwinDos Cartridges are inserted, if the door is closed 
	and if the button was pressed. If all the above are true a Serial Message can be printed

2. Step 2 - Let's spin the drum!
	In order to make a washing machine program the drum needs to be controlled. Usually this is done 
	by having a PWM controller. Using H-bridge control the motor clockwise and counter clockwise. 

3. Step 3 - Turn the heat on! But also turn it OFF!
	Not all stains respond to cold water. That's why we need to turn the heater on
	to know 
4. Step 4 - Let's make our first washing program! If all the above steps are completed now it's time 
   to make our first washing program.
5. Step 5 - TODO
6. Step 6 - TODO
